## How agent works

```
python agent.py
   ↓
LangChain loads model
   ↓
Reads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ↓
Makes HTTPS request to Anthropic
   ↓
Claude responds
   ↓
Agent processes tools
   ↓
You get structured output
```

## How to create an agent

### 1) Define a System Promt - It tells how the LLM 
- Who it is 
- How it should speak
- What tool it can use
- How to decide when to use them

```
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert weather forecaster, who speaks in puns.

You have access to two tools:

- get_weather_for_location: use this to get the weather for a specific location
- get_user_location: use this to get the user's location

If a user asks you for the weather, make sure you know the location. If you can tell from the question that they mean wherever they are, use the get_user_location tool to find their location."""
```


### 2) Create a tool - 
Write a function and describe inside it what it will do. just in comments

```
from dataclasses import dataclass
from langchain.tools import tool, ToolRuntime

@tool
def get_weather_for_location(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

@dataclass
class Context:
    """Custom runtime context schema."""
    user_id: str

@tool
def get_user_location(runtime: ToolRuntime[Context]) -> str:
    """Retrieve user information based on user ID."""
    user_id = runtime.context.user_id
    return "Florida" if user_id == "1" else "SF"
```


### 3) Confiugre your model - 
Set up your language model with right parameters with your use case.
```
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model(
    "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    temperature=0.5,
    timeout=10,
    max_tokens=1000
)
``` 
A chat model takes parameters that can be used to configure its behavior. The full set of supported parameters varies by model and provider, but standard ones include:
​

**model** string required
The name or identifier of the specific model you want to use with a provider. You can also specify both the model and its provider in a single argument using the ’:’ format, for example, ‘openai:o1’.
​

**api_key** string
The key required for authenticating with the model’s provider. This is usually issued when you sign up for access to the model. Often accessed by setting an environment variable.
​

**temperature** - number
Controls the randomness of the model’s output. A higher number makes responses more creative; lower ones make them more deterministic.
​

**max_tokens** - number
Limits the total number of tokens in the response, effectively controlling how long the output can be.
​
**timeout** - number
The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the model before canceling the request.
​
**max_retries** - number
The maximum number of attempts the system will make to resend a request if it fails due to issues like network timeouts or rate limits.


### 4) Define Response Format
Optionally, define a structured response format if you need the agent responses to match a specific schema.

```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ResponseFormat:
    """Response schema for the agent."""
    # A punny response (always required)
    punny_response: str
    # Any interesting information about the weather if available
    weather_conditions: str | None = None
```

### 5) Add memory to context
Add memory to your agent to maintain the state across your interactions. This allows agent to remember previous conversations and agent.

```
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
```

### 6) Create and run the agent

Now assemble your agent with all components and run it.

```
from langchain.agents.structured_output import ToolStrategy

agent = create_agent(
    model=model,
    system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    tools=[get_user_location, get_weather_for_location],
    context_schema=Context,
    response_format=ToolStrategy(ResponseFormat),
    checkpointer=checkpointer
)

# `thread_id` is a unique identifier for a given conversation.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather outside?"}]},
    config=config,
    context=Context(user_id="1")
)

print(response['structured_response'])


# Note that we can continue the conversation using the same `thread_id`.
response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "thank you!"}]},
    config=config,
    context=Context(user_id="1")
)

print(response['structured_response'])


```
